# ciphers-cryptograms

### some diy code to implementing ciphers-cryptograms from gravity falls with python, it's fun tho

## Algorithm or ciphers list

### Caesar
### Atbash
### A1Z26
### ABZA (this is my custom algorithm)
### Combination (coming soon i guess)

## How it works

first, it take the file (currently supported file is .txt) in the same directory as main.py
then read the content, and insert it into choosen algorithm
after that it create new "encrypted" file with the key, you can also decrypted that file, using this code too
