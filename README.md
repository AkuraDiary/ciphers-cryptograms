# sigma-ciphers-cryptograms 🥖

Yes, this was a DIY cipher inplementation inspired from gravity falls with python, but now, i've added my custom algorithm called Sigma (if you had a name suggestion, contact me please) so, what is Sigma ? simply it's the algorithm that stacked data from another simple ciphers algorithm

## Algorithm or ciphers list 🍞

- Caesar -> good old Caesar ciphers, with 3 shift parameter
- Atbash -> Reversing the letter
- ABZA -> A into B Z into A
- AN -> classic scout cipher, A into N and N into A (turns out, this is a Caesar ciphers with 13 shift parameter)
- A1Z26 -> A into 1 Z into 26 (this algorithm still need some adjustment to implement into Sigma)
 
if you had another classic algorithm or custom algorithm that you want to add into this project, you can contribute [here](https://github.com/AkuraDiary/sigma-ciphers-cryptograms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or contact me
 
- Sigma -> Wrapper algorithm / my custom algorithm

## Use Case ? 🥪
### - encrypting your private file
### - encrypting another people file (wait, that's illegal, or is it 🤨)
### - doing some encrypted message with your friend, or on exams 🤨
### - Implementing this into some service 🥖

## How to Use in Windows (Oversimplified)
- Make sure you have git and python 3 installed properly
- clone this repo using  ```git clone https://github.com/AkuraDiary/sigma-ciphers-cryptograms.git ```
- Just open terminal in where you save this project, and type ```py Sigma.py```
- and you will get into the CLI interfaces, here is the command list, although you could type `help`
```
###### Commands ######
exit : exit the program
help : show the help
encode : encode a message or file
decode : decode a message or file
nuke : nuke a directory
```

for linux users, you guys are pro, so you know what to do

## under renovation 🥯

## TODO NEW SCREENSHOOTS
    
## To Do Next 🥛
- ###  🌮 add file utilities
- ### ⌨️ add command line mechanism
- ### 🗃️ add more ciphers algorithm of course
- ### 🥜 add Nuke

## Contributing 🍪
### if you want to contribute into this project, i would be so happy, check how to contribute [here](https://github.com/AkuraDiary/sigma-ciphers-cryptograms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
> especially if you could help to remove "spaghetti code" and boilerplate you are very welcomed to contribute

## here's my gravity falls [refference](https://gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_cryptograms/Episodes)
`"It's so simple, until it's not and that's good, i guess"`
i'm trying to keep this simple, so i only using python built in library
and also, this is my first project with github copilot 😸
